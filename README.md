### Automated Apache Virtual Hosts for Linux

The Apache webserver allows multiple domains (or sites) to run on itself. These instances are called virtual hosts. As a developer, this is my preferred way of delveloping sites locally. I just give my locally developed site a unique top-level domain like .dev instead of .com 

Creating a virtual host involves quite a few steps. This script simply automates the process. Read the comments in the script carefully, as you may want to configure some things yourself. [This](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-apache-virtual-hosts-on-ubuntu-14-04-lts) is a good guide to learn more about the manual process.
